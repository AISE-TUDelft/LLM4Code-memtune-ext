## Directories

For detailed documentation of each directory, please refer to their respective README files.

### Data
Contains scripts and tools for dataset filtering and sample creation, organized into two main directories.

- The fine-tuning dataset can be retrieved at this link: [AISE-TUDelft/memtune-tuning_data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AISE-TUDelft/memtune-tuning_data)

### Training
Contains:
- Fine-tuning scripts for StarCoder2
- Training statistics and metrics

- The fine-tuned models can be retrieved at this link: [AISE-TUDelft/LLM4Code-memtune](https://huggingface.co/collections/AISE-TUDelft/llm4code-memtune-678a2838766dd16037a8bfe0)

### Evaluation
Contains code, data, and results for data extraction experiments.

- The generated data extraction benchmarks are available at [AISE-TUDelft/memtune-data_attack](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AISE-TUDelft/memtune-data_attack)
